# fizzbuzzwoof
A variation of fizz buzz

## How to run
1. Make a fork, then clone or download the file.
2. Using your terminal, go to the folder containing this file (e.g. cd <folder_name>).
3. Enter 'python fizzbuzzwoof.py' and results will be displayed.

## How this works
- Loop from 1 to 100.
- The number 3 = Fizz, 5 = Buzz, and 7 = Woof.
- The main rules in this game are that any number that CONTAINS the number or is DIVISIBLE by that number is replaced by an occurrence of the word.
- If the number has 2 instances of that number (i.e. 33 or 55) and is divisible by that number, then the word is said three times in this example.
- The additional rule is that the words (if more than one occur) must be said in the order given in the title (i.e. Fizz Buzz Woof). 
- For example,
<br/>1:
<br/>2: 
<br/>3: Fizz Fizz
<br/>4:
<br/>5: Buzz Buzz
<br/>6: Fizz
<br/>7: Woof Woof
<br/>8: 
<br/>9: Fizz
<br/>10: Buzz
<br/>11:
<br/>12: Fizz
<br/>13: Fizz
<br/>14: Woof
<br/>15: Fizz Buzz Buzz
<br/>...
<br/>30: Fizz Fizz Buzz
<br/>...
<br/>33: Fizz Fizz FIzz
<br/>...
<br/>35: Fizz Buzz Buzz Woof
<br/>...
<br/>55: Buzz Buzz Buzz
